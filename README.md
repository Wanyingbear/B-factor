## Introduction
This work presents a novel method for predicting protein flexibility based on the magnitude of finite metric spaces. Protein flexibility is critical for structural adaptability and biological function, influencing enzymatic catalysis, molecular recognition, and signal transduction. The magnitude, an invariant from category theory and algebraic topology, has been extended to graphs, hypergraphs, and material science. This study models protein structures as finite metric spaces with biologically relevant distance functions and uses magnitude to capture their geometric and topological properties, improving the prediction of B-factors, which represent atomic fluctuation. Experimental results on the Superset dataset show that our method achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.725, outperforming GNM, pfFRI, ASPH, opFRI, and EH. Compared to GNM, our approach improves PCC by 28.32%, demonstrating its performance advantage. Additionally, by combining magnitude with global and local structural features, we validate the methodâ€™s robustness in blind tests, proving its effectiveness in capturing protein flexibility and offering a novel approach to protein dynamics analysis.

**Keywords**: Protein flexibility, Magnitude topology, Finite metric spaces, B-factor prediction.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on the concept of magnitude from algebraic topology and category theory. It involves the following key components:

- **Finite Metric Space Representation**: Protein structures are modeled as finite metric spaces using biologically relevant distance functions.
- **Magnitude Calculation**: The magnitude of these finite metric spaces is calculated to capture geometric and topological properties.
- **Feature Extraction**: Magnitude values are used as features to predict protein flexibility.
- **Prediction Model**: A linear regression model is employed to predict B-factors based on the extracted magnitude features.

Further details about the model architecture and its components will be provided in the upcoming publication.
